# LS-Gantt-Project

## 🎉 **PROJECT STATUS: FOUNDATION COMPLETE**

**✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Successfully built and deployed a working Looker Studio Community Visualization!

### **✅ What's Working:**
- 🏗️ **Google Cloud Storage Setup**: Bucket configured and public
- 📋 **Manifest Validation**: Looker Studio accepts our visualization  
- 🔗 **DSCC Integration**: Data binding and configuration working
- 📊 **Data Pipeline**: Connected to sample_data.csv
- 💻 **End-to-End Flow**: From GCS → Looker Studio → Visualization

### **🎯 Next Phase: CP Gantt Implementation**
- Replace tutorial "Hello, viz world!" with CP Gantt visualization
- Implement stacked timeline bars for CP phases
- Add beautiful tooltips and interactions
- Test with real project data

## 📊 **CP Gantt Vision**

Building a beautiful, intuitive Gantt chart visualization for Looker Studio that displays:
- **Stacked CP Phases**: CP3, CP3.5, CP4, CP5 as continuous horizontal bars
- **Team Grouping**: Clear team separators with project timelines underneath  
- **Visual Polish**: Executive-ready design with hover tooltips and filtering
- **Data Source**: Initially Google Sheets, future Jira integration

### **🎨 Design Principles**
- Desktop-first approach (responsive design future consideration)
- Visual beauty with functional performance at scale
- Information hierarchy: filter down to single team/project or expand to view all
- Pure visualization tool (no direct data editing)
